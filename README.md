# Client-Server-Chat-in-Cpp-Using-Socket-Programming

**1. Introduction to Socket Programming:**

Socket programming is a networking paradigm that facilitates communication between processes running on different devices connected to a network. It enables the establishment of connections, allowing data exchange between a client and a server. Sockets serve as communication endpoints, providing a standard interface for processes to send and receive data.

**2. Creating a Socket with `socket()` System Call:**

The `socket()` system call is the initial step in socket programming. It is used to create a socket, which acts as a communication endpoint. The function takes three parameters: domain, type, and protocol. The domain specifies the address family (e.g., IPv4 or IPv6), the type indicates the socket type (e.g., SOCK_STREAM for reliable, connection-oriented communication), and the protocol defines the specific protocol to be used (often set to 0 for default).

**3. Connecting the Socket using `connect()` System Call:**

For client-server communication, the `connect()` system call is employed by the client to establish a connection with the server. It requires the socket file descriptor, the server's address structure, and the size of the address structure. The server must have previously created a socket and bound it to an address using the `bind()` system call.

**4. Sending and Receiving Data using `read()` and `write()` System Calls:**

Data exchange between connected sockets is achieved through the `read()` and `write()` system calls. The `write()` call is used to send data, while the `read()` call is used to receive data. These calls provide a straightforward mechanism for transmitting information between processes. For more complex scenarios, additional considerations such as buffering, error handling, and protocol design may be necessary.

In summary, socket programming involves creating sockets with the `socket()` system call, establishing connections using `connect()`, and exchanging data using `read()` and `write()` system calls. This foundational knowledge forms the basis for developing networked applications, where communication between client and server processes is essential.
